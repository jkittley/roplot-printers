# Roplot Firmware V1.0
This is the first version of the Roplotter firmware controller. 

## Hardware
We almost always use Adafruit hardware. Why, because it is well documented and works! This firmware was designed to work with the [Adafruit Feather M0 BLE](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2995), however it can easily be adapted to work with any Arduino style micro-controller and BLE module.

## Get Started
If you are not using the Adafruit Feather M0 BLE board then you will first need to open the `config.h` file and make sure all the settings match your hardware setup.

Next check the hardware instructions to make any build specific changes.

Finally, upload the `v1.ino` sketch to your board using the Arduino IDE and using the mobile phone app search for your Roplotter.
